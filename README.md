This is an Ruby on Rails application that I have been developing for a school project.

The Savings Organizer application is a tool for individuals who desire to organize their savings account(s) into separate items for which they are saving (e.g. new automobile, medical emergency, tax payment, etc.); thereby, facilitating the documentation and tracking of savings items for different purposes to meet saver's goals.
